TASK 1
This code defines a processArray function that takes an array of numbers as an argument. It uses the map method to create a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. The map callback function uses a conditional statement to determine whether to square or triple each number based on its parity.


TASK 2
This code defines a formatArrayStrings function that takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by processArray. It uses the map method to create a new array where each string is modified based on its corresponding number. The map callback function uses a conditional statement to determine whether to capitalize or convert to lowercase each string based on the parity of its corresponding number.


TASK 3
This code defines a createUserProfiles function that takes two arrays as arguments: an array of names and an array of modified names. It initializes an empty profiles array and a variable id set to 1. The function then uses a for loop to iterate through the names array and create a new object for each name, containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented id. The push method is used to add each object to the profiles array. Finally, the function returns the profiles array.
